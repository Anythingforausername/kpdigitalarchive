                    <p>Photography has been my creative outlet for over 8 years. What started as casual snapshots evolved into a serious passion for composition, light, and storytelling.</p>
                    <p>I focus primarily on street photography, capturing candid moments and urban landscapes. There's something magical about finding beauty in everyday scenes that most people walk past without noticing.</p>

                    <p>My gear includes a mix of digital and film cameras. While I appreciate the convenience of digital, there's an intentionality to shooting film that forces you to slow down and really think about each frame.</p>
                    <p>Recent projects have explored long-exposure cityscapes and portrait work with natural lighting. Each shoot teaches me something new about perspective and patience.</p>

                    <p>Guitar has been my constant companion for the past 5+ years. Started with basic chords and campfire songs, but gradually developed a deeper appreciation for music theory and technique.</p>
                    <p>I play both acoustic and electric, though I lean towards acoustic for its portability and warmth. Fingerpicking patterns and percussive techniques have become recent obsessions.</p>
                    <p>Music is meditative for me—a way to disconnect from screens and engage with something purely tactile and auditory. There's always another song to learn, another technique to master.</p>
